# About

This template is my personal working template I use for my new projects.

It contains the following features:

- a source folder that contains all source files of the project
- a gulp server for automatisation
- the possibility to make use of scss

# Installation

1. You need the latest npm and node version.
2. First, install `gulp` and `browser-sync` globally using the following command: `npm install gulp browser-sync -g`.
3. Switch to the empty project folder. Clone the Github-Project with `git clone https://github.com/dierks/template .`
4. Run `npm install --save-dev` to install the environment.
5. Run `gulp init` to initiate the project.
6. Start the server with `gulp`.

You're all set up!
